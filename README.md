## Unsolved Issues
    - I only subscribed for the limited access to the API, allowing me to only have some information. If I could, I would have preferred to have the full access. This would have let me present information about the mission, website and donation address for each charity.
    - I would have also liked to have cleaned up the show pages a little.
